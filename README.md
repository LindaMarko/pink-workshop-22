Hi and welcome to the PINK <> ustwo workshop!

## Setup

1. Install Node version 16.13.2, either from their download page or a package manager like Homebrew

- https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/

- https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/node

2. Install your IDE of choice, for example Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/download


3. Download or clone the repo, then run these two terminal commands inside the project directory 

- npm install

- npm start

A local server should now be running in your terminal and a calculator hopefully launched in your browser!
