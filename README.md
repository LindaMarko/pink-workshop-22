# pink-workshop-22

Hi and welcome to the PINK <> ustwo workshop!

Please, make sure you follow the setup steps below before the event. If you have any issues, don't worry! We'll do our best to help you troubleshoot on Sunday. 

## Setup

1. Install Node version 16.13.2, either from their download page or a package manager like Homebrew

- https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/

- https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/node


2. Install your IDE of choice, for example Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/download


3. Download or clone the repo, then run these two terminal commands inside the project directory 

- npm install

- npm start

A local server should now be running in your terminal and a shopping list hopefully launched in your browser!
